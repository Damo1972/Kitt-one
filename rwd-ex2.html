                    I know what time is ,Time is a thief
                    It'll steal into bed and rob you while you sleep and yoiu'll never feel it
                    It pulls off the covers and rifles through your head,then you wait to find you can't remember what
                    you just said
                    It happens to everyone
                    just like the father of my father, time stole his mind and I cant forget that one fourth of his
                    blood is mine
                    I try not to worry
                    Please don't come for me, I promise I'll be great ,Just let me kep what's mine
                    Please don't come for me, if you must then just please wait and let me have some Time
                    Mind over matter, when your mad as a hatter
                    It's hard to draw a clear distinction, who you are, who you were
                    Through the looking glass, the past and future begin to blur
                    And no one can blame you.
                    Well they say the world is what you make it, you think, speak and breathe and those rules still
                    apply, stuck in a world of make believe
                    You make the best with what your given
